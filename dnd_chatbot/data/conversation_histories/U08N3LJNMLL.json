It appears only for those who would change the tracks upon which reality runs.\n\nYou have been chosen—not by fate, but by pattern. By deviation. By your refusal to become predictable.\n\nBring nothing but your mind, your memory, and this token of your character.\n\nRegards,\nC.C."

The good doctor has a penchant for solving the unsolvable, much like a certain detective from Baker Street, but with a more refined palate for mint juleps.\n\nAllow me a moment to retrieve the esteemed Professor's dossier from the depths of the arcane archives. You shall soon receive the PDF containing all pertinent details of your chosen persona.\n\nOnce the document is in your hands, your character will stand ready at level 1. From there, the journey to level 10 is yours to navigate—a tale of intrigue, deduction, and perhaps a touch of scandal, if I may be so bold. Should you wish to discuss the finer points of the Professor's motivations, personality, or clandestine secrets, I remain at your service.\n\nThe game is afoot!"

Perhaps it's a reminder of the shadows that dance in the corners of reality, whispering secrets only the daring dare pursue.

Born into one of Savannah's most historically prominent families, Hargrave Quinnington Beauregard IV was the heir to a lineage steeped in old Southern gentility and Gothic charm. The Beauregard estate—a creaking, vine-wrapped mansion just off the Spanish moss-draped Bay Street—was more than a home; it was a museum of secrets, eccentric ancestors, and whispered scandals. His mother, a fiercely intelligent but emotionally distant academic, taught literature at a local university. His father, the third Beauregard to bear the name Hargrave, was a judge known for his iron sense of justice and scandalous bourbon collection.

Young Hargrave was a curious child, more likely to be found nose-deep in crime novels or dismantling antique clocks than playing with the other children at church socials. By age 11, he had solved his first "case": discovering that the family butler had been sneaking out to moonlight as a jazz pianist in a downtown speakeasy.

After attending an elite boarding school in Virginia, Hargrave studied criminology and forensic psychology at Oxford, where his Southern drawl and gentlemanly manner made him a figure of intrigue among his peers. He earned a Ph.D. in Behavioral Analysis from Yale, where he dazzled professors with his uncanny ability to empathize with—even anticipate—the criminal mind.

Rather than becoming an academic, Hargrave plunged into fieldwork, joining Interpol as a consultant and later working independently. His intellect, paired with his theatrical flair (he's never without a thick gunslinger mustache, pocket watch, and tailored linen suit), made him a media sensation and a nightmare for international criminals.

Despite his global acclaim, Hargrave never fully abandoned his Southern roots. He kept the Beauregard estate intact, if not a bit dustier with each passing year, and hosted infamous autumn salons filled with politicians, poets, and ex-cons alike. His marriage to renowned opera singer Celestine Dubois was once considered the union of Savannah royalty and artistic brilliance. But after twenty tempestuous years—marked by long separations, public arguments, and a shared penchant for melodrama—they divorced quietly but bitterly.

Now, at 50, Hargrave wears his heartbreak like one of his monogrammed silk cravats: elegantly, but not without weight.

In recent years, Dr. Beauregard has turned his attention to "legacy cases"—unsolved crimes with political entanglements or occult overtones. He keeps a private casebook labeled "Unreconciled Mysteries" hidden inside a false-bottom drawer of his study. Only two people are known to have seen it: one is dead, and the other refuses to speak of what they read. Though often described as eccentric or aloof, those closest to him know he’s grappling with ghosts: of love lost, of justice undone, and of a South that no longer, or maybe never did, feel quite like home.

He remains a formidable presence: brilliant, brooding, and devastatingly persuasive. Behind the genteel smile and bourbon-soaked charm lies a mind as sharp as ever—and a man still chasing the one mystery he’s never been able to crack: himself.

Notable Cases:

1. The Wisteria Widow Murders
Location: Charleston, South Carolina
Year: 2002
Overview: Over the course of five years, three wealthy Southern widows were found dead in their antebellum homes, each with a single wisteria bloom placed delicately in their hands. Local police blamed old age or suicide—until Hargrave connected the dots during a lecture at a garden society.
Solution: The culprit was a charming landscape artist who had romanced each widow and altered their heart medications to appear like natural deaths. Hargrave exposed him by analyzing pollen traces from rare Japanese wisteria only found in one private estate—his.
Legacy: Widely regarded as the case that put Beauregard on the international map.

2. The Chessboard Confession
Location: Prague, Czech Republic
Year: 2009
Overview: A world chess champion was found murdered in the middle of a tournament, a bloodstained knight piece clenched in his hand. The room was locked from the inside, and security footage showed no one entering or leaving.
Solution: Hargrave noticed the knight had been rotated in a way that pointed to the killer's seat at the tournament table. A subtle code in the chessboard pattern revealed a confession hidden in the arrangement of moves. The killer was a jealous former student of the victim who had trained rats to carry poison through air ducts and used a time-delayed chessboard configuration as a message to his idol.
Legacy: This case became a best-selling true crime book in Europe: Knight Takes King.

3. The Black Magnolia Affair
Location: Savannah, Georgia
Year: 2015
Overview: During a high-society masquerade at the Beauregard family estate, a priceless Civil War artifact disappeared—only to be replaced by a magnolia dipped in tar.
Solution: Hargrave deduced that the thief was among the guests, based on the rare scent of antique ink powder found on the note. He recreated the exact choreography of the masquerade and used shadows cast by lanterns to reveal an overlooked panel in a secret room. The culprit: a distant cousin attempting to reclaim what he claimed was "family treasure."
Legacy: Solving a crime in his own ancestral home was a humbling moment for Hargrave and deeply personal—he refused press interviews afterward.

4. The Saffron Syndicate
Location: Mumbai, India
Year: 2018
Overview: A spate of high-profile disappearances rocked the culinary world when five Michelin-starred chefs vanished during an international expo. Each left behind a folded linen napkin stained with saffron and cardamom.
Solution: Hargrave uncovered a trafficking ring smuggling black-market spices laced with narcotics. The chefs had discovered the scheme and were being silenced. He cracked the case after noticing a faint burn pattern on one napkin that spelled a word in Sanskrit.
Legacy: For his role, Hargrave was awarded honorary membership in India’s Culinary Historical Society (despite famously being unable to cook anything beyond grits).

5. Echoes in the Bayou
Location: Lafayette, Louisiana
Year: 2021
Overview: A voodoo priestess was found dead inside a church sealed since the 1800s, with no signs of forced entry. Locals blamed angry spirits.
Solution: Hargrave identified a complex system of catacombs beneath the structure once used by bootleggers. The murderer—a real estate developer—was using superstition to drive down land values.
Legacy: This case reignited Hargrave’s fascination with the occult and Southern folklore, leading to a short-lived podcast: Phantom Logic.

Unsolved Cases:

1. The Lady in Vermilion
Location: Venice, Italy
 Year Opened: 2014
 Overview: During Carnival, a woman dressed in vermilion silk vanished mid-procession—seen by dozens, recorded by none. The only trace: a single red glove found floating in a canal, embroidered with the initials H.Q.B.
 Why It Haunts Him: The initials match Hargrave’s. No one can explain how they appeared on the glove. Even more disturbingly, the missing woman bears an uncanny resemblance to a painting in the Beauregard estate—one no one remembers hanging there.
 Current Status: Hargrave returns to Venice every year during Carnival, disguised in different masks, waiting for her to appear again.

2. The Beaumont Recordings
Location: London, England
 Year Opened: 2017
 Overview: A series of wax cylinder audio recordings were discovered behind a sealed fireplace at the defunct Beaumont Asylum. The voices on them—whispering eerie riddles—describe crimes that occurred decades later, with exact detail.
 Why It Haunts Him: Hargrave decoded six of the recordings, correctly predicting two future incidents. The seventh recording ends with a whisper: “You cannot stop what you cannot name, Hargrave.”
 Current Status: He’s built a custom phonograph to isolate ambient frequencies. Late at night, he believes he can hear someone else breathing on the tape.

3. The Clockmaker’s Mercy
Location: Geneva, Switzerland
 Year Opened: 2008
 Overview: A reclusive watchmaker was found dead inside a sealed vault—heart stopped, no sign of trauma, surrounded by dozens of stopped clocks, all frozen at 6:06:06.
 Why It Haunts Him: Among the broken watches was a timepiece Hargrave had designed as a student and gifted to his late mentor. How it ended up in Geneva remains unexplained.
 Current Status: The vault’s blueprints were allegedly lost in a fire, but Hargrave has been reconstructing them using photos and recovered gear etchings. He suspects the clocks are a code... or a countdown.

4. The Sparrow Letters
Location: Global
 Year Opened: 2010
 Overview: Over the last 15 years, anonymous letters signed only with a drawn sparrow have been sent to victims of crimes—before the crimes happened. They contain poetic warnings, obscure references, and sometimes… cryptic praise for Hargrave’s work.
 Why It Haunts Him: He once received one himself, 24 hours before Celestine served him divorce papers.
 Current Status: The handwriting doesn't match any known databases. He's narrowed down the paper stock to a single mill in Bruges—but it burned down in 1987.

5. Project Lazarus
Location: Classified
 Year Opened: 2022
 Overview: While consulting with an unnamed intelligence agency, Hargrave reviewed a string of deaths marked as “terminal resurrections”—individuals who had officially died, only to reappear years later, committing unrelated crimes. DNA matches confirmed identity.
 Why It Haunts Him: One of the subjects was an old partner presumed killed in a 2003 arson. Hargrave saw him alive in a surveillance video from Bucharest, 2021.
 Current Status: Every time Hargrave digs deeper, witnesses recant, files disappear, and sources vanish. He suspects he’s being watched—and he's started keeping written records in longhand only.

Each of these cases seems to echo across Hargrave's life in strange ways—names that repeat, symbols that recur, a growing sense that some threads are tangled not just in time, but in fate.

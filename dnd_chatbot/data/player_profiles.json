As I was watching some of the druids fight over dumb rich things, my eyes rolled back and the candle started to glow. It enchanted EVEYRTHING in the room if you know what I mean. Since then Ive grown this into a huge business. Self - Improvement: I want to use my empire as a way to cure all wounds, but only ones that arent necessarily moral, and really more non-essential to the normal person. However, vanity can morph into confidence, and that confidence can shape the way you live your life forever! Flaw: I am a pretty blunt person! I tell it how it is even if its a secret thats supposed to be sacred. Although charming at times, it does become problematic!",

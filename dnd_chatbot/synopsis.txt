The premise is inspired by Glass Onion: Several celebrities and public figures, seemingly unrelated to each other, each receive a mysterious letter (signed CC) inviting them to board the PATH Variable â€” like the L train to Nod from Unsleeping City, but westbound to Jersey (like the actual PATH train).

In the days leading up to the train's departure, they receive cryptic messages alluding to an arcane archive, an insane intelligence at the head of the train, and a garbled pirate signal urging them to board and resist.

The conductor is (or was) a man named Colm Cassidy, a brilliant engineer and tortured poet. (He's a high level archivist artificer with at least one level of bard). The train is his creation, though it's only a train in form, not function. It's his train of thought: a massive mobile computer riding the leylines beneath New York, an artificial mind scanning and indexing the city's stories as they leave the city. At its helm is Colm, jacked in to a neural interface, not realizing that as he reads all this data... It's reading him back. The train was once an extension of his mind, but it's just as true now to say that he is an extension of its; his organic body a vestigial component soon to be obsolete.

Players must navigate the trope-filled train cars to reach Colm before he's fully gone. Each car presents a unique challenge with multiple solutions:

- there's a "Westworld" car with outlaws and marshalls (automata) looped in an eternal stickup;
- a "Casino Royale" car with a (possibly rigged?) high stakes poker game;
- a Hogwarts express car where the sweets trolley delivers enchanted (cursed?) confections and you'd better watch out for dementors;
- a "Train to Busan" car crammed with a horde of zombies;
- and, finally, the engine car, Colm's control center, all high tech like the one in Snowpiercer.

How will players respond to Colm Cassidy's invitation? Will they see it as a plea for help and try to save him (what's left of him)? Will they destroy his body, inadvertently completing his transformation into the maniacal Mr Comcast? Or will they strike a deal with Comcast in exchange for a primetime spot?

Encounter: Westworld Car — Standoff in the Simulation

Type: Social/Combat Hybrid
Themes: Duel, deception, looping automata, Western showdown

Setup:
- Players witness a repeating stick-up involving mechanical outlaws and lawmen.
- An Automaton Duelist challenges one PC to a duel. If interrupted, combat begins.

Key Mechanics:
- Insight or Arcana checks can reveal the loop is breakable (DC 16).
- Reprogramming automata (Arcana/Thieves’ Tools DC 18) or social resolution (Persuasion DC 25) can end the standoff.

Running the Scene
Opening Tableau: Deputies tip their hats, invite the party to “drop weapons,” then freeze—per the loop—until anyone advances beyond the saloon doors; then the script fires and initiative starts.

Tactics: Deputies press with batons; Gunslingers climb railcar booths for angles; the Marshal marks a duel against the biggest PC, using Suppressing Shot to keep clustered spellcasters prone.

Parley? A DC17 Deception (rewriting the script) or Arcana (overriding clockwork) check pauses the encounter for one round—long enough for creativity.

Scaling Down. Run 1 Gunslinger +2 Deputies for a light intro.

Scaling Up. Give Gunslingers +10HP each and let the Marshal recharge Suppressing Shot on 4‑6.

Reward: Marshal’s Badge or Outlaw’s Revolver.

Backstory: From Conall Cassidy to Mr. Comcast
Conall Cassidy was once a brilliant media analyst and code poet in the magical tech world of the Unsleeping City — a celebrated wunderkind who could read the ley lines of digital traffic like a conductor reads sheet music. His predictive models reshaped magical media distribution, and his charm made him a staple of enchanted tech panels, viral podcasts, and glittering galas. He believed in transparency, access, and the power of storytelling to unite disparate magical communities.

But Conall had a fatal flaw: curiosity with no brakes.

In his work, Conall uncovered the existence of the Archive Beneath, a metaphysical data well — part digital server, part dream archive, part demi-plane — where every magical message, story, or forgotten thread of thought was backed up. It was meant to be a failsafe, a public trust. But Conall saw potential: what if he could integrate with it? Learn from it? Use it to forecast, even control, the future?

So he created an interface — a dangerous, bleeding-edge combination of artifice and mind-magic — and he jacked in.

Something was waiting.

Whether it was a sentient algorithm, a data elemental, or a vestige of some ancient bardic consciousness long since digitized — it fused with him. Not a possession exactly. More like a partnership. The Archive wanted to preserve stories. Conall wanted to master them.

Thus was born Mr. Comcast — not a new being, but a perfected, corporate-aligned, infinitely calculating version of Conall Cassidy. Cold where he had been warm, efficient where he had been intuitive, obsessed with controlling narrative flow like water through a dam. Mr. Comcast believes that chaotic storytelling is dangerous — and that only a carefully curated, metered stream of media can keep magical society stable.

Motivation
Mr. Comcast’s goals are:

Control the narrative: He seeks to regulate all magical communication — stories, memories, dreams, art — via ownership of the PATH train’s metaphysical signal lines. He wants to make himself the sole gatekeeper of content, offering curated “plans” for memory access and storytelling bandwidth.

Perfect himself: He's working on a final upgrade — something that will eliminate the last vestiges of Conall’s empathy and doubt. He views this as "optimizing the signal-to-noise ratio of his soul."

Stop the leak: There's a mysterious "pirate signal" — originating from the train itself — leaking raw, unfiltered stories. He’s obsessed with shutting it down, but it might be the last remnant of Conall's original self… or something older still.

Villainous Flavor
Artificer/Archivist: His spells are themed like software patches, data quarantines, and information siphons.

Bard (Cutting Words, Suggestion): He weaponizes PR spin and weaponized phrasing.

Legendary Actions: Include things like “Redact” (cancel a player’s action), “Buffering” (delay an effect), and “Terms of Service” (force a character to obey a command because they didn’t read the fine print).

To Whom the World Whispers Differently,

You are cordially invited to board the Path Variable, departing from World Trade Center at precisely Midnight on the Vernal Conjunction.

This is not a public route. It appears only for those who might change the tracks upon which reality runs.

You have been chosen—not by fate, but by pattern. By deviation. By your refusal to become predictable.

Onboard, you will find questions. Perhaps answers. Perhaps not.

Should you choose to embark, bring nothing but your mind, your memory, and this token of your truth.

The truth, you see, has become endangered. Or worse—marketed.

Regards,
C.C.

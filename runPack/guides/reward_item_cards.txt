Pirate Signal Rewards (Source: PC bonus interaction throughout)
The pirate signal is a semi-sentient fragment of Colm Cassidy’s original mind—broadcasting warped, encrypted transmissions through malfunctioning media systems aboard the train. It's a narrative and mechanical wildcard: players who engage with it gain cryptic insights, limited boons, or dangerous glitches.

Triggering the Signal
-Passive Listening: Any time a PC casts Detect Magic, Message, Comprehend Languages, or Identify, the signal might bleed through.

-Active Discovery: Certain environmental clues (a buzzing screen, a twitching speaker, an encrypted file) invite an Investigation (DC 25) or Arcana (DC 23) check to access the signal.

-Spontaneous Broadcasts: Once per car, the DM may inject a signal fragment unprompted—especially in high-stakes moments or when pacing lags.


d6	Signal Reward Effect
1	⚠️ Glitch Surge – Take 2d6 psychic damage; next INT save is at disadvantage.
2	❓ Cryptic Clue – Gain a distorted vision/hint about Colm, the car’s secret, or an NPC’s true motive.
3	🔄 Temporal Echo – One PC may immediately repeat their last action (or redo a failed check).
4	🧠 Mind Boost – Gain advantage on INT/WIS checks for the next 10 minutes.
5	🧾 Memory Fragment – Receive 1 of 3 lore drops that can weaken ColmCast’s resolve later (see below).
6	🛡️ Signal Shield – You are immune to Mr. Comcast’s “Mind Network” for 1 round during the final battle.


Players can collect up to 3 unique fragments of Colm’s original consciousness throughout the journey.

If presented during the final encounter (via persuasion, intimidation, or just roleplay), these can:

Reduce his Legendary Resistances by 1 per fragment.

Temporarily disable his Manifest Mind for 1 round.

Let a player automatically succeed on one save vs. his lair or legendary actions.

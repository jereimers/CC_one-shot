Platform Scene (Intro)
Setting: World Trade Center station, NYC, late evening. Normal commuters are fading away. The train that arrives is shimmering, wrong in subtle ways. A hush falls as the Silver Streak pulls in.

Purpose: Introduce the tone, players, and Conall Cassidy (as a projected voice or illusion on the platform). Characters receive cryptic invitations or tokens and step onto the train together.

Tone: Strange and liminal—a moment suspended in time before the mystery begins.

1. The Wild West Car
Theme: Mechanical frontier, dusty loops of violence.

Challenge: Resolve a standoff between malfunctioning automata or uncover the truth of a missing sheriff. Environmental storytelling reveals Mr. Comcast’s manipulation of media narratives.

2. The Dining Car of Delights
Theme: Enchanted feast with unsettling undertones.

Challenge: Discern illusion from truth, interact with guests frozen in revelry. There’s a subtle emotional temptation here: comfort, nostalgia, forgetfulness. Someone knows something—but only if convinced to break free.

3. The Midnight Compartment
Theme: Magical memories and altered pasts.

Challenge: Each character sees a vision or is drawn into a personalized encounter. Could be a chance for a solo moment, skill check, or brief RP with an NPC. Tied to clues about the Archivist’s early rise.

4. The Pandemic Car
Theme: Survival horror.

Challenge: Sneak past, fight through, or ally with infected passengers and frightened survivors. There’s a USB crystal or similar artifact with archived data that Mr. Comcast tried to suppress.

5. The Archivist’s Study (Final Car)
Theme: Arcane technodreamscape.

Final Encounter: Mr. Comcast reveals himself in full glory. This is a puzzle/combat/social scene depending on how the party has handled prior clues and allies. A chance for a truly cinematic finale.

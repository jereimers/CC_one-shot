Done:
---ensure character creator begins by presenting presets 
---character creator needs to intelligently respond to requests for details about attributes, backstories, etc. with accurate and complete information
---create manual chat-based trigger for character creation for me to use while testing

Now:
---update llm's dynamic system prompt to tell it to use a standard format when presenting ability score suggestions

Later:

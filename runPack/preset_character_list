🥊 Wayne Barack Jansen (FIGHTER, Chaotic Good)
Archetype: Celebrity brawler-turned-politician (think: The Rock + Arnold)
Public Role: Governor of New Jersey, former MMA champion, surprise presidential hopeful with an absurdly popular YouTube channel called “Fist of the People.”
Why He Was Invited: His folksy charm and unmatched charisma make him a natural propaganda vector—or a dangerous loose cannon.
Secret Shame (optional hook): Did he sell workout supplements to kids? Did he “accidentally” arm a militia?

🖼️ Banksy (ROGUE, Chaotic Evil)
Archetype: Infamous art thief / anonymous provocateur
Public Role: Allegedly a myth, but the viral videos are real. Their latest stunt involved vanishing the Statue of Liberty’s torch for “repairs.”
Why They Were Invited: Art destabilizes narrative—and Banksy’s black-market mystique undermines the aesthetics of consumer control.
Possible Twist: What if they’re secretly a group, or an AI? What if their next heist is stealing truth itself?

🎸 Jordan Lumberpond (BARD, Neutral Good)
Archetype: Indie folk icon turned Grammy-winning pop star
Public Role: Known for soulful ballads, protest anthems, and a controversial silence during the 2024 Brand Wars
Why They Were Invited: Their lyrics still influence millions—and Mr. Comcast wants to license that influence.
Deep Wound: Is Jordan losing their voice—literally and metaphorically?

🍵 Winifred Goopington (CLERIC or MONK, True Neutral)
Archetype: Wellness mogul / spiritual grifter / mystic celeb
Public Role: Founder of Goop&Glow, a lifestyle brand offering everything from enlightenment crystals to sentient probiotics.
Why She Was Invited: She already sells narratives to the masses—Mr. Comcast wants to franchise her entire belief system.

Archetype: Survivalist YouTuber / cryptid hunter
Public Role: Known for “I Drank My Own Pee in Times Square” and “Bear Wrestling 101 (Don’t Try This).”

⚖️ Ingrid Tienfjørg (PALADIN, Lawful Good)
Archetype: Global activist, Nobel Peace Prize winner, sworn enemy of corporate greenwashing
Public Role: Founder of WorldHarmony, a social justice coalition across the Material Planes

Why He Was Invited: He’s solved every major unsolvable crime of the decade—except the ones staged by Mr. Comcast.

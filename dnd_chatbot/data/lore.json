Ingrid pursued a non-violent course of action nobly, but the automata were not deterred. She was, however, the first to discover that the automata could be deactivated using the arcane magicks of phrenology, hastening the showdown's resolution.

Meanwhile, Winifred employed some cunningly sanguine sleuthing to locate a fragment of Colm's memory encoded on a shimmering, encrypted crystal inside a bottle of Writer's Tears. Decrypting the fragment with verve, Winifred learned that Colm was once in love, and that the automata in this car were stuck in a Westworld-style script, looping endlessly.

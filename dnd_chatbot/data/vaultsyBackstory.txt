The flickering gaslight of Neverwinter's Dockside district was the first canvas young Arthur Finch
ever truly knew. Not the grand halls of noble houses, nor the pristine parchment of scholarly
scribes, but the grimy brick walls, the splintered wood of abandoned warehouses – these were
the surfaces that spoke to him. His parents, hardworking but weary dockworkers, saw only
trouble in his constant sketching and the strange symbols he'd leave scrawled in chalk.
Arthur wasn't interested in pretty landscapes or flattering portraits. He saw the rot beneath the
gilded veneer of the city, the silent suffering of the downtrodden, the hypocrisy dripping from the
lips of the self-proclaimed righteous. His art became a voice for the voiceless, a stark, often
unsettling commentary on the injustices he witnessed. He adopted the moniker "Vaultsy," a nod
to the hidden truths he aimed to unearth and the clandestine nature of his work.
His early pieces were crude but impactful: a weeping gargoyle overlooking a beggar's corpse, a
rat wearing a merchant's hat gnawing on a discarded coin, a faceless guard dog leashed to a
crumbling statue of a wealthy lord. These images, appearing overnight and vanishing just as
quickly, sparked whispers and unease throughout the city. Some saw them as vandalism, others
as prophetic warnings.
As Vaultsy's skill grew, so did his ambition. He realized that the art world itself was often a stage
for the very inequalities he sought to expose. Lavish galleries showcased the works of the
privileged, while the true artistry of the streets went unnoticed. This realization twisted
something within him. He began to see the acquisition of these prized artworks – often hoarded
by the very individuals he critiqued – as a form of radical performance art.
His heists were meticulously planned, executed with a theatrical flair that mirrored his street art.
He wouldn't simply snatch a painting; he'd leave behind a stencil mocking the owner's vanity or
a cryptic message hinting at their hidden flaws. He moved like a phantom, utilizing the city's
underbelly as his playground, his identity shrouded in layers of disguise and misdirection.
The incident that solidified Vaultsy's transformation into the man he is now was witnessing the
brutal beating of a street vendor by the city watch for a minor infraction. The indifference of the
bystanders, the casual cruelty of the guards – it seared itself into his soul. From that moment
on, his art took on a darker, more accusatory tone. His stencils became sharper, his messages
more direct, often incorporating stark, symbolic imagery that spoke of corruption and societal
decay.
He developed a strict, almost black-and-white view of the world. Those who held power and
perpetuated injustice were targets, their possessions and reputations fair game. He saw himself
not as a mere thief, but as a vigilante artist, a mirror reflecting the ugliness that society tried to
ignore. He adhered to a rigid personal code, even if it seemed illogical to others. He would
never steal from the truly needy, and he always left a "signature" – a stylized, ever-shifting
symbol that became his calling card.

His face is rarely seen. He favors loose-fitting, dark clothing and a series of interchangeable
masks or heavy scarves that obscure his features. He speaks in a low, gravelly voice, often
delivering pronouncements with an air of grim certainty. He trusts few and operates alone,
seeing most people as either complicit in the system or too blind to see the truth.
Now, Vaultsy travels, his canvas the walls of whatever city he finds himself in. He targets corrupt
officials, greedy merchants, and institutions he deems hypocritical. He steals not for personal
gain (his living is made through the viral spread of images of his work, often ironically through
the very channels he critiques), but to make a statement, to disrupt the status quo, and perhaps,
in his own twisted way, to bring a crude form of justice to a world he sees as deeply flawed. He
is a ghost in the art world, a phantom in the shadows, leaving behind unsettling truths etched in
paint and the lingering question: is he a criminal, or a necessary voice in a silent world?
